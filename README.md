# Chatbot

This is my chatbot that I build to hold a basic conversation if I am not available. I obviously used python and neural networks to train the bot.


## Run Locally

Clone the project and feel free run the bot. Make sure you have the appropriate libraries installed, I reccomend using conda to compile and run this application. Call this command in your terminal to see if you have conda.
```
conda
```
